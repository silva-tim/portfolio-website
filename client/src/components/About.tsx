          I come from a long family tree of bankers and often thought that being
          in the financial industry was also the right choice for me. I spent a
          few years working at a financial advisory firm and although I learned
          a lot I also came to the realization that I was not thrilled about
          pursuing a career in finance. When Covid-19 effectively shut down my
          college I decided to change paths and began exploring programming. I
          have always had a strong passion for computers/technology and I
          quickly found out just how much I enjoyed programming. In order to
          learn as much as I could, I enrolled in an accelerated program where I
          created several projects and collaborated with peers to learn the
          technologies and tools that are used in the industry today. Iâ€™m a
          people person with a love for building all the unique ideas that I can
          come up with. My current interests revolve around front-end web
          development, mostly React and Tailwind but I am always seeking to
          learn more.
